# cordova-ionic-css-jquery

This is a template for cordova app with a side menu which uses the ionic css components. It allows the developper to skip angular framework while taking advantage of the ionic css components.

The sections are loaded through a function at js/custom.js via the load() jquery method. You must edit the titles of the sections at this file. I recommend you to open the index.html with firefox rather than Chrome (may not display the content of the sections).
